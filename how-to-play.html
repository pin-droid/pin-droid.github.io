                                Bluesky</a> for updates, clues & annoucements for games to win more pins!</li>

                        <li>Use the Leaderboard to keep track of, not only your points & other's points, but also the
                            specific pin types people have acquired! <a href="/leaderboard.html">Leaderboard Link</a>

                            gain an edge here!</li>
                        <li>Use the "Which pins are still available" page to see which exact pins have already been
                            scanned, helping you decide if you should accept a "GIFTED" pin or not<a

                    <li class="answer">My advice is to search physically around the conference booth areas, there are likely at least 100 pins in that area most of the time!</li>
                    <li class="question">Yo I actually made it all the way down this page and read all the crap above... Can I have a pin?</li>
                    <li class="answer">SURE! The first 10 people that come to me and say "Ken Badel the evil Baron from earth" can have a pin... why not!</li>
