                <p class="explainer-p">NEW Pin Idea Doodle Competition - Droidcon Berlin 2025</p>
                <p class="explainer-p">Welcome to the Pin-Droid Doodle Competition! We're looking for your most creative
                    and imaginative ideas for a new Pin-Droid Pin Badge (The winner MIGHT even become a real pin next
                    year!). Show off your artistic skills by sketching or
                    designing a new pin, and you could win extra pins to use in the Pin-Droid game at Droidcon Berlin!
                    2025!</p>
                <p class="explainer-p">
                    The aim is for you to design your OWN Pin Badge! The theme/topic of the designed pin should losely
                    align to Android or Pin-Droid or Droidcon, but it doesn't need to! It is a very flexible competition
                    & we want to see your creativity mostly! Your entry will be judged by an annoymous judge or judges
                    so maybe think what a judge would find favourable with this information in mind! But it's up to you,
                    funny/serious/happy/sad whatever it is, its up to you! I have provided some really crappy eaxmples
                    below to help you understand the bar/level/approach.
                </p>
                <p class="explainer-p">To enter, simply create an image of your new pin idea and submit it through the
                    entry form. The competition is open to everyone, whether you're a seasoned designer or a casual
                    doodler. The winner will be judged on the originality and quality of their pin design, earning a
                    prize that will help them get a head start in the Droidcon Berlin Pin-Droid game.</p>
                <p class="explainer-p explainer-imp">The winner of this mini-extra-competition will be decided by an
                    impartial judge (with no names or bias attached).</p>
                <p class="explainer-p explainer-imp">The winner will also win a collection of valuable Pin-Droid pins
                    for the Main Pin-Droid competition!</p>

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Submission Format: </span>All entries must be
                        submitted as an image file. No other file types will be
                        accepted.</li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Latest Entry Time: </span>The submission must be
                        submitted using the online google form BEFORE the official 'cut-off' time. This is the moment
                        the form will be locked! If you have submitted before it is locked, great, if not then too late!
                        The official closing time will be 1 hour before the end of the Pin-Droid Main Competition, so
                        entries can be judged!
                    </li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Keep the Image Annoymous: </span>In order to make
                        sure the judging is not biased in anyway shape or form, please make sure not the label or name
                        your lovely illustration/design! Its important that creativity wins, not people's friends!
                    </li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Entry Requirement: </span>You must submit your
                        entry using the same email address that you used to
                        register for the Pin-Droid game. This is done on the google form itself!</li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Originality: </span>The image must contain your
                        own drawing, sketch, or graphic design. This can be
                        created by hand or with a computer program (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, Illustrator). YES it can be a
                        self-created computer graphic too, not just a drawing!</li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">AI-Generated Images: </span>
                        AVOID using AI to generate the image for you! - It's not against the rules as we cant enforce
                        it, but any images that are clearly AI generated will be immediately judged worse against the
                        human-made counterparts! - of course you could use AI and if you make it look human made and it
                        slips through our net then, fair enough you have probably earnt it!
                    </li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">File Size: </span>The submitted image file must be
                        10MB or smaller. There is a 10MB image size limit, for my own poor google drive to survive! So
                        it's on you yourself to compress the image or figure out a way to make it fit within those
                        limits!</li>
                    <li class="explainer-li"><span class="rule-title">Prizes: </span>The winner of this competition will
                        receive extra pins as a prize, which can be used in
